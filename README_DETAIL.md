WHY????
--------------
Simply put: We want to encourage more people to learn and understand, to know the ideology of github.  
Of course, them are quasi-programmer and non-programmer but who need multi-person collaborative production project.
So that caused the pointer of this project: ***Let them practice using github without contribution of code***.

Will this project take up a lot of GitHub resources?
---------------
No.  
Github has its limit: the size of repo cannot exceed 1024MB.
The contributor are asked to compress pictures. If the picture is not up to standard,
or the size of the picture is larger than 1MB, the pull request will be closed. This is also a github-workflow training for them.
In future, We might regularly delete past documents (and their record) to ensure the size of the repo.

Is this project really helpful?
---------------
I think, yes.  
This project can (and already) aroused a lot of interest to use github and teached a lot of people 
"the ideology and the workflow of github and how to simply use github" in an easy-to-understand way.  
This project also develop their team cooperation ability: join the discussion and solve problem such as 
how to ctrl the size of repo, maintenance the repo, and so on.
